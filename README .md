# C++ Fundamentals

Learning C++ with focus on memory management, pointers,
and data structures as foundation for CUDA GPU programming.

## Projects
- 01-list-manager: vectors, control flow, menu interface
- 02-apply-all: heap allocation, pointer returns, 2D row-major indexing
- 03-letter-pyramid: nested loops, boundary handling, index arithmetic

## Goal
Preparation for CUDA kernel development and AI infrastructure engineering.
